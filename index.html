                Proudly Mexican born in the northern city of Juárez, on Chihuahua state.  Maried with a wonderfull lady from Durango since 1989. Father of a beatiful lady and three monsters, and also grand'pa of two incredible kids (9 & 2). <br><br>
                I describe my self as passionate. In this short life, its a waist of time to spend time in something that doesn't ignite us from the inside. For sure it entails some risks, but it is worth it. <br><br>
                Love biking and jeeping offroad; always present in parties (I'm trying to avoid piñatas) <br> <br>
                For work, I have had the opportunity to work with people and teams from different regions and cultures. For about a decade I was a frequent traveler in three continents. It was a enricher opportunity, but it also means that you become a weekend's daddy. For the last two years my travels have been reduced drastically, which gives me the opportunity to enjoy my family. I usually do 3-4 days of home-office by week.  Almost 15 years with my current employer (Tier-1 supplier for Automotive industry) <br><br>
